# NetRunner Playsheets

These are A3 'playsheets' for the asymettric card game NetRunner, with a sort of classic Mac OS (System 6.0-ish) styling.

They're intended to be a useful memory aid for people who don't play very frequently, but understand the basic structure of the game.

## Features
- Entirely in grayscale, largely in black-and-white
- Fairly visually clean
- Easy to toggle different elements in e.g. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to make them cleaner
- Includes some game setup hints (e.g. "Collect 5 credits as your starting pool")
- Available actions are described in multiple places
- "Click trackers" extended to include Draw and Discard phases

## Antifeatures
- The Runner sheet is deliberately a bit messier than the Corp one
- Many hints etc. are covered up by cards during the course of play
- Mixes vector and pixel art, the latter at variable resolutions
- Doesn't use the NSG symbol for Clicks (because I like the Mac OS watch too much)
- Doesn't try to be comprehensive

## Credits

_NetRunner_ is maintained by [Null Signal Games](https://nullsignal.games/), and the playsheets attempt to accurately reflect the rules that they've published (v24.03 as of writing).
