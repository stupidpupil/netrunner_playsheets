# NetRunner Playsheets

These are A3 'playsheets' for the asymettric card game NetRunner, with a sort of classic Mac OS (System 6.0-ish) styling.

They're intended to be a useful memory aid for people who don't play very frequently, but understand the basic structure of the game.

## Features / Antifeatures
- Entirely in grayscale, largely in black-and-white
- Fairly visually clean
- Easy to toggle different elements in Inkscape to make them cleaner
- Mixes vector and pixel art, the latter at variable resolutions
- Doesn't use the NSG symbol for Clicks (because I like the Mac OS watch too much)

## Credits

_NetRunner_ is maintained by [Null Signal Games](https://nullsignal.games/), and the playsheets attempt to accurately reflect the rules that they've published (v24.03 as of writing).

These playsheets incorporate graphical work from:
